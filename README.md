# itl-deep-seg
Scripts for deep segmentation with custom losses, metrics, light models, pre- and post-processing with Tensorflow 2 (keras-based)

## Segmentation and auxiliary Python-scripts

**train_test.py** - training and testing of segmentation model in single python-script

**config.py** - all main configs and settings for scripts

**data_preprocess.py** - data generators, dataset preparation, data post processing

**model.py** - different metrics, losses and segmentation model

              Implemented models: 
                  
                  UNetMCT (Light UNet-like architecture with ConvTranspose layers)

## Folders in the repository:

**models** - pretrained models
